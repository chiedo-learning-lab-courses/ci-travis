Nice work! Now that we've added an unit test to check for broken links, a broken link was just committed to our pull request and out Circle unit test caught it!

Notice how the two unit tests **build** and **testlinks** both show as Circle checks in our build, but the build unit test succeeds while the testlinks build fails due to a broken link. Also notice that even though the testlinks test fails, we are still able to merge in the pull request. The merge isn't blocked because only the build test is required to pass before merging. 

When adding unit tests, you can decide which ones are required to pass before allowing the pull request to merge. You can navigate back to the **Settings** tab and under **branches**, check the box next to the unit test to make it a required check.

## Step 10: Fix the broken link

Even though it's not required, let's fix the broken link so both Circle checks are passing. You can click on the **Details** link next to the failed **testlinks** Circle test for more information. By doing so, you'll find the following error:

```
External link https://help.github.com/setupgithub failed: 404 No error
```
