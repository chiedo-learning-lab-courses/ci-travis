Nice work! We've added a unit test to check for broken links. When a broken link was committed to our pull request, the test caught it and let us know the build had failed.

Clicking on the **Details** link next to one of our statuses shows the following:

Notice how the two stages **build** and **testlinks** both show as Travis CI jobs in our build. Also, notice that even though the `build` test succeeds, we are blocked from merging because our branch protection requires all jobs to pass in our build before merging.

## Step 10: Fix the broken link

To get our checks to pass, let's fix the broken link so both Travis CI checks are passing. You can click on the **Details** link next to the failed **testlinks** Travis CI test for more information. By doing so, you'll find the following error:

```
External link https://help.github.com/setupgit failed: 404 No error
```
