Nice work! We've added a unit test to check for broken links. When a broken link was committed to our pull request, the test caught it and let us know the build had failed.

Notice how the two parts **build** and **testlinks** both show as Travis CI checks in our build, but the build unit test succeeds while the `testlinks` build fails due to a broken link. Also, notice that even though the `testlinks` test fails, we are still able to merge in the pull request. The branch protection only requires a build test before merging.

When adding tests, or **jobs**, you can decide which ones must pass before allowing the pull request to merge.

## Step 10: Fix the broken link

Even though it's not required, let's fix the broken link so both Travis CI checks are passing. You can click on the **Details** link next to the failed **testlinks** Travis CI test for more information. By doing so, you'll find the following error:

```
External link https://help.github.com/setupgithub failed: 404 No error
```
