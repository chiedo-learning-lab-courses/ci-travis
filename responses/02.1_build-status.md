Nice work getting this pull request opened! 

This adds the bare bones `.circleci/config.yml` configuration file that will return a successful build. As you can see, there currently isn't much to this file, but we're going to change that. 

You'll notice a [Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/) that will be used to exectute the build, and a `checkout` that allows Circle to checkout to your project.

Since Circle will only run a build after new commits are added, add the below text to the file in place of the `REPLACE-ME-WITH-DOCKER-IMAGE` placeholder:

```yaml
circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node-browsers
```

## Step 3: Specify the Docker image

To get the CI build to succeed, replace the placeholder text and commit the change.
