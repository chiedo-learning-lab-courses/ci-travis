With the addition of links to our code base, we should probably add a unit test as one of our Circle jobs that run whenever it builds. Let's add a test using HTMLProofer to test for any broken links, images, or HTML. By adding this to our `testlinks` unit test, HTMLProofer will test our code before it gets merged.

I've already added the unit test for our HTMLProofer test to run, but i'll need you to replace the placeholder text with the following:

```yaml
bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site --check-html
```

## Step 9: Add an HTMLProofer unit test

Let's make sure all links are valid by adding a link checker unit test.

### :keyboard: Activity: Check for broken links using Circle

1. Under **Files changed**, locate the `run html proofer` test under the `testlinks` unit test
1. Replace the `REPLACE-ME-WITH-SCRIPT` placeholder text with `bundle exec htmlproofer ./_site --check-html`
