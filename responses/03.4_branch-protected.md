Awesome, nice work getting those branch protections in place :tada:

However, just before you enabled your branch protections, a contributor committed invalid syntax on `master` therefore breaking your CI build. Fortunately, your newly created test for successful builds caught it and you turned on branch protections so these types of errors won't make it into future builds.

Looking at your build status, click on the **Details** link as shown below:

You notice you get the following error:

Explain the error:
```shell
  Liquid Exception: Liquid syntax error (line 1): Unknown tag 'site' in docs/01_getting_ready_for_class.md
```

Jekyll uses an open-source templating language to load data dynamically and implement conditional logic called, Liquid. Some of the Liquid syntax in one of the files is incorrect. 

## Step 6: Fix the broken build

Let's find the broken syntax and fix the build!
