Great work enabling CI on your repository!

Now that it's enabled, let's see what happened when we ran our first build. [Navigate](https://github.com/a-a-ron/continuous-integration/commits/master) to the last commit on `master`. Notice that the commit now has a red ‚ùå  next to it, and clicking on it will give you the following information:
