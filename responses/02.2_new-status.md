Nice work getting your CI build to succeed! :tada:

Notice that your pull request shows all checks have passed with 2 successful checks.

You'll notice that there are two build status checks. One build is for the branch and the other build is for the pull request (more accurately, the merge of your `initial-travis-config` branch into the base branch `main`).

### Why did my CI build succeed?

The `.travis.yml` file defines your build environment and which automated tests to run. The entire delivery process is defined through this single `.travis.yml` file. If this file is present and your commit passes the tests as outlined in the `.travis.yml` file, your CI build will succeed.

## Step 3: Merge the configuration

Now that our CI build is succeeding, merge this pull request so the `.travis.yml` file is pushed to `main`.
