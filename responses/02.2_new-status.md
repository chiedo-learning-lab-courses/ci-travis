### Why did my CI build succeed?

The `.travis.yml` file defines your build environment and which automated tests to run. The entire delivery process is defined through this single `config.yml` file. If this file is present and your commit passes the tests as outlined in the `config.yml` file, your CI build will succeed. 

## Step 3: Merge the configuration

Now that our CI build is succeeding, merge this pull request so the `.travis.yml` file is pushed to `master`.
