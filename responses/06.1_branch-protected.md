Awesome, nice work getting those branch protections in place :tada:

But, right before you enabled your branch protections, something happened. A contributor committed invalid syntax on `master` and broke your CI build. Luckily, your new test caught it and you turned on branch protections. These types of errors won't make it into future builds.

> Note: If your build is still processing, you may not see the failed test yet. If you wait a few minutes, it should be done soon.

Looking at your build status, click on the **Details** link as shown below in one of your builds:

Navigate to the **Build Failed** section and click on the build failed link:

Notice that you get the following error:

```shell
  Liquid Exception: Liquid syntax error (line 1): Unknown tag 'site' in docs/01_getting_ready_for_class.md
```

Jekyll uses Liquid, an open-source templating language. Liquid loads data dynamically and implements conditional logic. Some of the Liquid syntax in one of the files is incorrect.

## Step 6: Fix the broken build

Let's find the broken syntax and fix the build!
