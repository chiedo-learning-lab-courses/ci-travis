# Welcome

In this repository, we'll be diving into the world of Continuous Integration, also known as CI, and how it can benefit your GitHub project. If you're new to Continuous Integration, or haven't had too much experience with it, you may be thinking, "What exactly is it and do I need it in my project?"

## What is Continuous Integration and why should I care?

Continuous Integration ([CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)) tools help you stick to your team’s quality standards by running automated tests every time you push a new commit and [reporting the results](https://blog.github.com/2015-09-03-protected-branches-and-required-status-checks/) to a pull request. This helps reduce the amount of bugs being deployed into production when your branch is merged.  

There are several CI tools that [integrate with GitHub](https://github.com/works-with/category/continuous-integration), some of which you can install in a few clicks from [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration). With so many options, you can pick the best tool for the job even if it’s not the one that comes pre-integrated with your system.

The following diagram shows the relative percentage of the top 10 CI tools used with GitHub.com, based on the most used commit status contexts used within our pull requests.

Our analysis also showed that many teams use more than one CI tool in their projects, allowing them to emphasize what each tool does best.

The tools that will work best for you depends on many factors, including:

- Programming language and application architecture
- Operating system and browsers you plan to support
- Your team’s experience and skills
- Scaling capabilities and plans for growth
- Geographic distribution of dependent systems and the people who use them
- Packaging and delivery goals
