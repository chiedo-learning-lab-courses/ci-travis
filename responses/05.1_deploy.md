Our workflow is looking pretty good! We have now set up some automated tests to validate any new changes by creating a build and running automated unit tests against that build, but we can go one step futher and add continuous deployment to our workflow.

### What is Continuous deployment

Continuous deployment, also known as CD, is every new change that passes all required CI tests and merged will automatically be deployed to production. This reduces the need for a release day and gives developers the satisfaction of seeing their work in production shortly after their changes are deployed.

There are several ways to deploy your code changes, but for our case, we'll be using GitHub pages to deploy our changes. This deployment method is nice since GitHub pages is built into all Git repositories on GitHub. 

## Step 12: Deploy

Deploying with GitHub pages will result in automatic deployments anytime changes are merged into master.
