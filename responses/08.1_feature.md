With the addition of links to our code base, we should add a unit test as one of our Travis CI jobs that run whenever it builds. Let's add a test using HTMLProofer to test for any broken links, images, or HTML.

We'll now add the HTMLProofer test, but we'll also refactor some of the commands away from the config file into standalone test scripts.

## Step 9: Apply batch suggested fixes to refactor config

Let's make sure all links are valid by adding a link checker unit test, and packaging into test scripts.
