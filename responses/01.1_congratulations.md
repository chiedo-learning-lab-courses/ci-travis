Great work enabling CI on your repository!

### What's a build?

Every time you push code, your CI service clones your repository to a virtual environment. It installs necessary dependencies, compiles your code, and runs tests. If everything goes well, the "build" is successful. Sometimes, your build will fail the test, giving you valuable feedback to diagnose the issue.

### Build failure

Now that the integration is enabled, you might have noticed that the build failed.

Our build failed because it was missing key information -- we currently don't have a configuration file in our project. A configuration file is necessary for our CI to look for tests to run. Once it passes those tests, generate a successful build.

> Note: You may notice email notifications from the integration. To change the settings, see [Travis CI's documentation on notifications]().

## Step 2: Introduce the configuration file

On GitHub, let's add a configuration file to our project to generate a successful build. I already created a branch and committed the configuration file. Next, you'll need to open up a pull request.

1. Create a [new pull request]({{ prUrl }}) using `base: master` and `compare: initial-travis-config`
