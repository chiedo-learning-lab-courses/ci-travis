Once you've written code on GitHub, how do you make sure it's bug free? Continuous integration (CI) is a requirement in modern software development. Adding automated tests and controls to your pipeline saves you time and gives your team improved reliability. 

## What you'll learn 

In this course we'll answer common questions, like:
- How do I configure Travis CI to work with GitHub?
- How can I protect my branches so CI tests pass before merging is allowed?
- What are build statuses?
- How do I create a test?

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- Identify when a project is using continuous integration
- Set up continuous integration for one of your projects
- Protect branches based on the result of a build from continuous integration
- Customize builds
- Add tests for your project 
- Define continuous delivery
- Define continuous deployment
